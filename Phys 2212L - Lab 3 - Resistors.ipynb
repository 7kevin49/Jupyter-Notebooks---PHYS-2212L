    "In this experiment (but not in all Wheatstone bridges), resistors, $R_1$ and $R_2$, are provided by a 1.00 m long conducting wire that may be tapped at any point along its length to divide its total resistance into two parts, $R_1$ and $R_2$. Resistor, $R_K$, is the resistor of known resistance; resistor, $R_U$, is the resistor of unknown resistance. The resistances of $R_1$ and $R_2$ are varied until the galvanometer indicates that no current flows across it. In this condition the potential difference across the galvanometer is zero.

Therefore, verification of the linear relationship between resistance and length of a conducting wire of uniform cross-sectional area must precede measurements with the Wheatstone bridge.\n",
    "    1. The first objective of this experiment is to verify that linear relationship. This will be accomplished by placing a constant potential difference across the full length of the wire and measuring the voltage drop across a variety of partial lengths of the wire. Since the current in the wire is constant, the voltage drop across a given portion of the wire is proportional to the resistance of that portion of the wire. Thus, a graph of voltage drop versus wire length should be a straight line.\n",
    "    2. For the second objective, a single known resistance will be used in the Wheatstone bridge apparatus to determine the resistances of a variety of resistors. The actual values of the resistances will be determined using a multimeter and the percent discrepancy in the results will be calculated. A graph of the percent discrepancy versus actual resistance will be used to develop conclusions about the suitability of the Wheatstone bridge method for measuring resistance."
