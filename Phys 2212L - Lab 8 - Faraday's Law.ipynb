    "* to verify the dependence of the induced emf in a coil on the time rate of change of the magnetic flux through the coil.\n",

    "* In this experiment a bar magnet will be released from rest and allowed to fall freely along the central axis of a solenoid. While the magnetic field of a bar magnet is a complex function of position, the magnetic flux through the solenoid at any particular position along the central axis will be the same regardless of how fast the magnet is moving. The rate of change of the magnetic flux at a particular position will, however, be larger if the magnet is moving faster. Thus, we would expect the induced emf at a particular position to be directly proportional to the speed of the magnet.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Lenz's law requires that a current be produced in the solenoid to create a magnetic flux that opposes the change in magnetic flux produced by the falling magnet. As a result a magnetic field opposite that of the bar magnet is produced as it approaches the solenoid, and in the same direction as that of the bar magnet as it leaves the solenoid. This means that the falling bar magnet will feel forces other than that due to gravity. However, the weight of the bar magnet is much greater than the magnetic forces, and we will approximate its motion as free fall. Thus, the speed of the center of the bar magnet released from rest as it passes through the center of the solenoid is given by:\n",

    "The emf as a function of time shows a maximum and a minimum (the student is responsible for explaining the reasons for the variation of emf with time). The variation in emf may also appear as a minimum followed by a maximum, depending on the pole of the magnet which first enters the solenoid and the polarity of the connection used to measure the emf. The\n",
    "midpoints of the bar magnet and the solenoid coincide at the time when the emf is zero between the maximum and minimum. Since the magnet is falling faster after it passes through the center the magnitude of the minimum (in this example) is larger in magnitude than the maximum that came before it.\n",

To test the relationship between emf and rate of change of magnetic flux, a graph of the average of the magnitudes of the maximum and minimum induced emfs versus speed at the midpoint will be constructed. Based on the discussion in this section, the relationship should be linear."
