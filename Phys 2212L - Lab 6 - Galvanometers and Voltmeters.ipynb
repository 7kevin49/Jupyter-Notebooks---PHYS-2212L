    "* A D'Arsonval galvanometer is a current sensing device. The galvanometer contains a coil of wire in a magnetic field which will experience a torque when a current passes through the wire of the coil. The coil is attached to a pointer and a spring so that the amount of deflection of the pointer is proportional to the current in the wire of the coil.\n",
    "* The galvanometer is characterized by its internal resistance, $R_g$, and its current sensitivity, K. The current sensitivity is the amount of current that must be applied to the galvanometer to produce a deflection of the pointer through one major division of the galvanometer scale. Current sensitivity has units of A/div. The internal resistance and current sensitivity of the galvanometer will be measured using the circuits shown in Figures 1 and 2.\n",

The voltage required to obtain full-scale deflection will be recorded. The circuit shown in Figure 2 will be constructed by adding the shunt resistor, Rs, in parallel with the galvanometer. Without changing the applied voltage, the load resistance will be varied until the galvanometer again has a full-scale deflection. The new load resistance, $R_2$, will be recorded. In both circuits, the potential difference supplied by the power supply is the same, as is the current passing through the galvanometer (full-scale deflection in both circuits).
