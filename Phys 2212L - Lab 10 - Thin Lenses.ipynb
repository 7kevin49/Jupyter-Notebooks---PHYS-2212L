    "    2. Parallel beam shift. A laser beam is aligned to pass through the center of the lens. A slab of transparent material is then rotated in the beam in front of the lens. Refraction in the slab produces beams parallel to the central axis beam. Since parallel rays converge at the focal point of a lens, the distance from the lens to a screen can be varied until the rotation of the slab produces no motion in the position of the laser beam on the screen. When this condition is met, the image distance is equal to the focal length.\n",
    "    3. Measurement of the object and image distances, and calculation of the focal length. If these distances are measured, the focal length can be calculated directlly using the thin lens equation.\n",
    "* Using the focal lengths determined from the measurements described in paragraph 2c3) above, combinations of the two lens will be used to test the predictions of the thin lens equation. When multiple lenses are used, the image of the first lens becomes the object for the second lens. Thus, for two lenses, two applications of the thin lens equation will be required to predict the image position produced by both lenses. The predicted and measured positions of such images will be compared."
