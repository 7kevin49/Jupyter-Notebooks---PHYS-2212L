    "**Theory**.\n",
    "An EKG, also called an electrocardiogram or ECG, is a reading of the electrical signal generated from the heart. In a hospital, one usually observes an EKG on a computer monitor, oscilloscope, or printed strip. The EKG tells the doctor whether the heartâ€™s rhythm and electrical conduction is normal or if further heart tests are necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "With each heart beat, the pacemaker of the heart (called the SA node) conducts electricity. The electrical current travels from the SA node in the right upper chamber of the heart down to the two lower chambers, the ventricles, of the heart. The electrical activity always precedes each contraction. Electrodes placed throughout the body record the signal generated from the heart. A normal EKG signal typically has five waves:\n",
    "  \n",
    "**P wave** - represents the electrical signal in the upper chambers ( depolarization of the atria) of the heart and occurs before the atria contract to squeeze blood into the lower chambers (the ventricles). Repolarization of the atria is hidden by the QRS wave.\n",
    "\n",
    "**QRS wave** - represents the electrical signal that occurs before the ventricles squeeze blood out through the aorta and to the body ( depolarization of the ventricles).\n",
    "\n",
    "**T wave** - represents the electrical signal that occurs just before the upper chambers of the heart expand and refill with blood ( repolarization\n",
    "of the ventricles).\n",
    "\n",
    "Some typical times for portions of the EKG:  \n",
    "* P-R Interval: 120-200 milliseconds  \n",
    "* QRS Interval: under 100 milliseconds  \n",
    "* Q-T interval: under 380 milliseconds"
